# EY_HackPions_2.0_Team_Bolt_Intel_Information_Risk_Analyzer
* There are various sort of risk associated with an organization inspired from incidents which time and again need to be understood, monitored and analyzed properly or else can have an adverse impact on the performance and growth of the organization. 
* The basic idea behind this problem is to analyze the information received from various sources and identify the different sorts of risk triggered by some incidents and understand the amount of risk it brings to the firm and its possible impacts.
* Objective was to create a web application that can take email as input and identify the source, risk category, and the country mentioned in the mail and gives a table of content which includes crucial details dynamic risk score, impact score, the severity of the risk, etc. along with EY information of the area/region/country as an output. 
* Along with that, a dynamic dashboard is required where the company can visualize meters related to various risks and can analyze the severity of the various risk as per the geographical location. Also, its required to include various time-series graphs for risks in order to understand patterns and make strong. And for better understanding, provide intelligent information. conclusions

## Data
### Dataset 
This folder contains various mails received from various sources regarding different sort of risks occured in different countries and cities. Input can be given in one of the following ways:

### This [Ipynb](https://github.com/abhinav0000004/EY_HackPions_2.0_Team_Bolt_Intel_Information_Risk_Analyzer/blob/main/impactAnalysis%20.ipynb) contains the entire code to extract all the infromation from the mail along with the prediction of the kind of risk associated with the mail, factors which helps in calculating the risk score and Impact score.
While there are other scripts as well for [newsScrapping](https://github.com/abhinav0000004/EY_HackPions_2.0_Team_Bolt_Intel_Information_Risk_Analyzer/blob/main/news_Scrapping.ipynb) and [incidentForcasting](https://github.com/abhinav0000004/EY_HackPions_2.0_Team_Bolt_Intel_Information_Risk_Analyzer/blob/main/forecast.ipynb)
