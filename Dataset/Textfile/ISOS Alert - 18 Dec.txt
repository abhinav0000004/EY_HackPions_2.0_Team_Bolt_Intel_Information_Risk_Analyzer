Movement 
on 
Vanua 
Levu 
island 
can 
resume 
with 
caution, 
following 
the 
passage 
of 
former 
severe 
tropical 
cyclone 
Yasa 
and 
the 
lifting 
of 
a 
related 
curfew 
on 
19 
December. 
Yasa 
has 
been 
downgraded 
to 
a 
Category 
1 
storm 
(lowest 
on 
a 
five-tier 
scale) 
by 
the 
Fiji 
Meteorological 
Service 
(FMS) 
and 
is 
expected 
to 
dissipate 
by 
21 
December. 
Nonetheless, 
associated 
damage 
and 
disruption 
in 
the 
worst-affected 
areas 
can 
be 
expected 
to 
persist 
in 
the 
coming 
days. 
MORE 
DETAIL 
All 
cyclone-related 
curfews 
imposed 
across 
the 
country 
have 
been 
lifted. 
From 
19 
December, 
the 
natiowide 
curfew 
reverts 
to 
COVID-19-related 
hours, 
from 
23.00 
to 
04.00 
(local 
time). 
Operations 
at 
Nadi 
(NAN) 
and 
Nausori 
(SUV) 
international 
airports 
on 
Viti 
Levu 
have 
gradually 
normalised 
since 
18 
December. 
The 
authorities 
have 
also 
announced 
that 
all 
public 
transport, 
ferry 
services 
and 
local 
businesses 
can 
resume 
operations. 
Flight 
cancellations 
were 
previously 
reported 
at 
the 
aforementioned 
airports, 
while 
all 
ferry 
and 
public 
transport 
services 
were 
cancelled 
on 
17 
December. 
Impact 
At 
least 
four 
people 
have 
been 
killed 
in 
cyclone-related 
incidents. 
Twenty-one 
houses 
and 
a 
community 
hall 
were 
destroyed 
in 
Tiliva 
(Bua 
province, 
Vanua 
Levu), 
where 
Yasa 
made 
landfall. 
Flooding 
has 
rendered 
roads 
inaccessible 
and 
cut 
off 
telecommunications 
in 
parts 
of 
Vanua 
Levu, 
but 
the 
authorities 
are 
working 
to 
restore 
essential 
services 
in 
affected 
areas. 
Flooding 
and 
strong 
winds 
have 
also 
damaged 
infrastructure 
on 
Koro 
and 
Taveuni 
islands. 
Across 
the 
country, 
including 
on 
Viti 
Levu, 
power 
outages 
and 
disruption 
to 
water 
supply 
and 
telecommunications 
have 
been 
reported. 
These 
may 
last 
several 
days 
or 
even 
weeks, 
as 
had 
occurred 
following 
the 
passage 
of 
former 
severe 
tropical 
cyclone 
Harold 
in 
April. 
Yasa 
may 
also 
exacerbate 
existing 
water 
supply 
issues 
in 
southern 
Naitasiri 
province 
(Viti 
Levu). 
WHAT 
WE 
ADVISED 
YOUR 
PEOPLE 
Inbound 
travellers 


2 



 
Continue 
to 
defer 
travel 
to 
Fiji 
due 
to 
restrictions 
related 
to 
COVID-19. 
Managers 


 
Regularly 
monitor 
the 
status 
of 
staff. 
Establish 
communication 
protocols 
for 
vulnerable 
employees 
and 
ensure 
they 
adhere 
to 
them. 
Telecommunications, 
including 
mobile 
internet 
services, 
may 
be 
temporarily 
disrupted 
in 
affected 
areas, 
making 
it 
difficult 
to 
contact 
stranded 
employees. 
 
Continue 
to 
monitor 
the 
FMS 
website 
for 
up-to-date 
information 
on 
weather 
conditions. 
 
Ensure 
staff 
comply 
with 
all 
local 
government 
directives 
amid 
ongoing 
emergency 
response 
efforts. 
Those 
in 
worst-affected 
areas 


 
Movement 
can 
resume 
with 
caution 
after 
confirming 
the 
feasibility 
of 
overland 
journeys. 
 
Check 
with 
local 
contacts 
or 
the 
authorities 
that 
your 
planned 
routes 
are 
clear 
of 
flooding 
and 
debris 
and 
open 
to 
traffic. 
At 
a 
minimum, 
check 
the 
Fiji 
Road 
Authority’s 
website 
or 
social 
media 
page. 
A 
map 
of 
affected 
routes 
is 
also 
available 
here. 
Allow 
additional 
time 
to 
complete 
your 
journeys. 
 
Avoid 
low-lying 
and 
coastal 
areas 
due 
to 
the 
potential 
for 
flash 
floods 
caused 
by 
further 
heavy 
rain. 
In 
addition, 
roads 
are 
likely 
to 
be 
blocked 
by 
debris 
and 
flooding 
during 
and 
after 
heavy 
rain. 
Do 
not 
attempt 
to 
drive 
through 
flooded 
areas 
and 
stay 
away 
from 
fallen 
trees 
and 
power 
lines. 
If 
you 
come 
across 
a 
flooded 
road, 
turn 
around 
and 
find 
another 
route 
to 
your 
destination. 
In-country 
employees 


 
Members 
in 
other 
parts 
of 
Fiji, 
including 
the 
capital 
Suva 
on 
the 
main 
island 
of 
Viti 
Levu, 
should 
reconfirm 
transport 
and 
logistics, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
feasibility 
of 
overland 
journeys 
via 
local 
contacts. 
 
The 
intensity 
and 
trajectory 
of 
tropical 
storms 
can 
change 
abruptly. 
Continue 
to 
monitor 
the 
FMS 
website 
for 
up-to-date 
information 
on 
weather 
conditions. 
Be 
prepared 
to 
adjust 
itineraries 
at 
short 
notice. 
 
We 
do 
not 
hold 
specific 
information 
on 
flights 
and 
other 
modes 
of 
transport. 
If 
planning 
to 
travel 
in 
areas 
affected 
by 
Yasa, 
reconfirm 
transport 
bookings 
with 
the 
relevant 
service 
providers. 
At 
a 
minimum, 
check 
the 
Fiji 
Airports 
social 
media 
page 
for 
updates 
on 
airport 
status 
nationwide 
before 
setting 
out. 
In 
the 
event 
of 
any 
cancellations, 
your 
travel 
agent 
will 
be 
able 
to 
assist 
with 
alternative 
arrangements.
