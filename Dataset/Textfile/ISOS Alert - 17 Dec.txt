Members 
in 
Fiji 
should 
stand 
fast 
until 
at 
least 
18 
December 
during 
the 
passage 
of 
Severe 
Tropical 
Cyclone 
Yasa. 
The 
Category 
5 
cyclone 
(highest 
on 
a 
five-tier 
scale) 
made 
landfall 
over 
Bua 
province 
(Vanua 
Levu 
island) 
at 
around 
19.00 
(all 
times 
local) 
on 
17 
December 
and 
continues 
to 
move 
south-east. 
The 
authorities 
declared 
a 
month-long 
state 
of 
natural 
disaster 
on 
16 
December. 
A 
nationwide 
curfew 
is 
in 
place 
until 
06.00 
on 
18 
December. 
Associated 
heavy 
rainfall 
has 
caused 
severe 
flooding 
and 
landslides 
in 
the 
affected 
areas. 
Further 
significant 
disruption 
to 
infrastructure 
and 
essential 
services 
can 
be 
expected 
in 
the 
coming 
days.

According 
to 
the 
authorities, 
more 
than 
600,000 
people 
in 
Fiji 
will 
be 
affected 
by 
Yasa. 
More 
than 
1,000 
evacuation 
centres 
have 
been 
opened 
and 
residents 
in 
coastal 
areas 
have 
been 
advised 
to 
evacuate 
to 
higher 
ground. 
According 
to 
the 
FMS, 
Yasa 
may 
generate 
waves 
of 
at 
least 
45 
feet 
(14 
metres). 
Flight 
cancellations 
have 
been 
reported 
at 
Nadi 
and 
Nausori 
international 
airports. 
The 
Fiji 
Natural 
Disaster 
Management 
Office 
(NDMO) 
has 
suspended 
all 
ferry 
and 
public 
transport 
services 
until 
further 
notice. 
All 
schools 
and 
bank 
branches 
under 
the 
Association 
of 
Banks 
in 
Fiji 
are 
also 
closed. 
The 
NDMO 
has 
assured 
the 
public 
that 
essential 
services 
will 
remain 
available. 
Power 
outages 
and 
disruption 
to 
water 
supply 
and 
telecommunications 
have 
been 
reported, 
including 
in 
Viti 
Levu. 
This 
may 
last 
several 
days 
or 
even 
weeks. 
Following 
the 
passage 
of 
former 
severe 
tropical 
cyclone 
Harold 
in 
April, 
power 
was 
not 
restored 
for 
several 
weeks. 
Yasa 
may 
exacerbate 
existing 
water 
supply 
issues 
in 
southern 
Naitasiri 
province 
(Central 
division, 
Viti 
Levu). 
WHAT 
WE 
ADVISED 
YOUR 
PEOPLE 
Inbound 
travellers 
 
Continue 
to 
defer 
travel 
to 
Fiji 
due 
to 
restrictions 
related 
to 
COVID-19. 
Managers 
 
Regularly 
monitor 
the 
status 
of 
staff 
during 
and 
after 
Yasa’s 
passage. 
Establish 
communication 
protocols 
for 
vulnerable 
employees 
and 
ensure 
they 
adhere 
to 
them. 
Telecommunications, 
including 
mobile 
internet 
services, 
may 
be 
temporarily 
disrupted 
in 
affected 
areas, 
making 
it 
difficult 
to 
contact 
stranded 
employees. 
 
Continue 
to 
monitor 
the 
Fiji 
Meteorological 
Service 
(FMS) 
website 
for 
upto-
date 
information 
on 
weather 
conditions. 
 
Ensure 
staff 
comply 
with 
all 
local 
government 
directives 
amid 
ongoing 
emergency 
response 
efforts. 
In-country 
employees 
 
Stand 
fast 
during 
the 
storm’s 
passage. 
Follow 
all 
directives 
issued 
by 
emergency 
response 
officials, 
including 
instructions 
to 
evacuate. 
Prepare 
a 
grab-bag 
with 
essentials 
such 
as 
a 
torch 
(flashlight), 
water, 
batteries 
and 
high-energy 
foods 
in 
case 
an 
emergency 
relocation 
becomes 
necessary 
 
Ensure 
you 
have 
access 
to 
a 
medical 
kit 
and 
essential 
supplies, 
including 
sufficient 
food 
and 
water. 
If 
in 
urban 
centres, 
ensure 
that 
you 
have 
enough 
supplies 
to 
stand 
fast 
for 
at 
least 
72 
hours. 
As 
aid 
may 
be 
limited 
outside 
of 
major 
urban 
centres 
and 
in 
the 
island 
groups, 
you 
should 
be 
able 
to 
stand 
fast 
for 
at 
least 
a 
week 
if 
you 
are 
in 
these 
areas. 
Expect 
disruption 
to 
essential 
services 
such 
as 
electricity 
in 
the 
event 
of 


3 



any 
infrastructure 
damage. 
Charge 
all 
communications 
devices 
and, 
where 
feasible, 
keep 
extra 
batteries 
for 
backup. 
 
Avoid 
low-lying 
and 
coastal 
areas 
ahead 
of, 
during 
and 
after 
Yasa’s 
passage 
due 
to 
the 
potential 
for 
storm 
surges 
and 
flash 
floods. 
 
The 
intensity 
and 
trajectory 
of 
tropical 
storms 
can 
change 
abruptly. 
Continue 
to 
monitor 
the 
FMS 
website 
for 
up-to-date 
information 
on 
weather 
conditions. 
Be 
prepared 
to 
adjust 
itineraries 
at 
short 
notice. 
 
Expect 
disruption 
to 
transport 
due 
to 
the 
cyclone’s 
passage, 
including 
at 
Nadi 
(NAN) 
and 
Nausori 
(SUV, 
both 
Viti 
Levu 
island) 
international 
airports. 
We 
do 
not 
hold 
specific 
information 
on 
flights 
and 
other 
modes 
of 
transport. 
If 
planning 
to 
travel 
in 
areas 
affected 
by 
Yasa, 
reconfirm 
transport 
bookings 
with 
the 
relevant 
service 
providers. 
In 
the 
event 
of 
any 
cancellations, 
your 
travel 
agent 
will 
be 
able 
to 
assist 
with 
alternative 
arrangements. 
 
Any 
essential 
movement 
should 
be 
conducted 
after 
reconfirming 
the 
feasibility 
of 
overland 
journeys 
via 
local 
contacts 
before 
setting 
out. 
Roads 
in 
the 
worst-affected 
areas 
are 
likely 
to 
be 
blocked 
by 
debris 
and 
flooding. 
Do 
not 
attempt 
to 
drive 
through 
flooded 
areas 
and 
stay 
away 
from 
fallen 
trees 
and 
power 
lines. 
If 
you 
see 
a 
flooded 
road 
ahead, 
turn 
around 
and 
find 
another 
route 
to 
your 
destination.
