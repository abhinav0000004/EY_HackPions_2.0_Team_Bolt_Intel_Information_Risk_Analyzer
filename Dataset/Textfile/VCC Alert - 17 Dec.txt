Tropical 
Cyclone 
Yasa 
continues 
to 
move 
toward 
Fiji. 
The 
storm 
was 
last 
reported 
to 
be 
around 
200 
miles 
northwest 
of 
Nadi, 
moving 
to 
the 
east-southeast 
at 
six 
miles 
per 
hour. 
Currently 
the 
equivalent 
of 
a 
Category 
5 
storm 
on 
the 
Saffir-Simpson 
scale, 
Yasa 
is 
exhibiting 
maximum 
sustained 
winds 
of 
160 
miles 
per 
hour 
and 
gusts 
of 
up 
to 
190 
miles 
per 
hour. 
The 
storm 
is 
forecast 
to 
pass 
between 
Fiji 
s 
main 
islands 
of 
Viti 
Levu 
and 
Vanua 
Levu 
late 
on 
Thursday 
or 
early 
Friday 
local 
time, 
likely 
as 
a 
Category 
4-equivalent 
tropical 
cyclone. 
Direct 
impacts 
from 
the 
storm 
are 
expected 
to 
be 
strongest 
in 
Fiji 
from 
Thursday 
afternoon 
through 
Saturday 
morning. 
After 
Friday, 
Yasa 
is 
expected 
to 
swing 
back 
to 
the 
southwest, 
with 
some 
forecasts 
indicating 
that 
it 
may 
impact 
New 
Zealand 
in 
the 
coming 
days, 
although 
models 
are 
not 
yet 
entirely 
certain. 


Assessment: 
Prime 
Minister 
Frank 
Bainimarama 
has 
urged 
residents 
of 
Fiji 
to 
prepare 
for 
heavy 
rain, 
high 
winds, 
storm 
surge, 
and 
possible 
nationwide 
flooding. 
Officials 
with 
the 
Fiji 
Meteorological 
Service 
have 
warned 
that 
effects 
from 
Tropical 
Cyclone 
Yasa 
will 
likely 
be 
devastating. 
Evacuations 
have 
been 
carried 
out 
in 
some 
locations, 
particularly 
low-lying 
and 
coastal 
areas, 
where 
the 
risk 
of 
flooding 
from 
storm 
surge 
or 
rain 
is 
highest. 
COVID-19 
prevention 
measures 
are 
likely 
to 
be 
in 
place 
at 
evacuation 
centers, 
but 
it 
is 
hard 
to 
maintain 
social 
distancing 
in 
crowded 
shelters, 
and 
evacuations 
during 
the 
pandemic 
remain 
a 
concern, 
even 
in 
Fiji, 
which 
has 
been 
relatively 
less 
affected 
by 
the 
outbreak. 
Schools 
in 
the 
country 
are 
closed, 
with 
many 
being 
used 
as 
evacuation 
locations. 
Police 
have 
been 
assisting 
in 
evacuations, 
including 
by 
stationing 
additional 
officers 
at 
evacuation 
centers 
due 
to 
past 
reports 
of 
assaults, 
thefts, 
and 
other 
crimes 
that 
have 
occurred 
during 
evacuations. 
Police 
are 
also 
increasing 
patrols 
and 
setting 
up 
additional 
road 
checkpoints 
in 
order 
to 
guard 
against 
possible 
looting. 
Residents 
have 
begun
