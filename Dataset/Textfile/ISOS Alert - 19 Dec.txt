Members 
in 
Vanua 
Levu 
island 
until 
at 
least 
19 
December 
should 
minimise 
non-essential 
movement 
following 
the 
passage 
of 
Severe 
Tropical 
Cyclone 
Yasa. 
The 
cyclone, 
currently 
a 
Category 
3 
(third 
highest 
on 
a 
five-tier 
scale), 
made 
landfall 
on 
Vanua 
Levu 
on 
17 
December. 
It 
has 
since 
exited 
Fiji 
and 
is 
moving 
in 
a 
south-east 
direction 
away 
from 
the 
country. 
The 
authorities 
have 
allowed 
public 
transport 
to 
resume 
and 
businesses 
to 
re-open. 
A 
nationwide 
curfew 
is 
also 
in 
place 
for 
18 
December. 
The 
curfew 
will 
be 
from 
17.00-06.00 
(all 
times 
local) 
in 
Vanua 
Levu 
and 
from 
20.00-05.00 
in 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
country. 
MORE 
DETAIL 
Strong 
winds 
are 
still 
expected 
in 
the 
rest 
of 
Fiji, 
with 
rough 
to 
very 
rough 
seas 
for 
18 
December. 
There 
is 
still 
potential 
for 
storm 
surges 
at 
low 
lying 
coastal 
areas, 
with 
heights 
of 
up 
to 
10 
feet 
(3 
metres) 
possible 
during 
high 
tide 
in 
the 
evening 
of 
18 
December. 
Flooding 
in 
low-lying 
areas 
and 
areas 
near 
water 
bodies 
remain 
possible 
in 
Vanua 
Levu 
and 
low-lying 
areas 
of 
eastern 
Viti 
Levu. 
At 
least 
two 
people 
have 
reportedly 
died 
as 
a 
result 
of 
the 
storm. 
Twenty-one 
houses 
and 
a 
community 
hall 
were 
destroyed 
by 
Yasa 
in 
Tiliva 
(Bua 
province, 
Vanua 
Levu), 
where 
the 
storm 
made 
landfall. 
Parts 
of 
Vanua 
Levu 
have 
been 
rendered 
inaccessible 
by 
flood 
waters 
and 
are 
without 
communications 
but 
authorities 
are 
working 
to 
restore 
essential 
services 
in 
affected 
areas. 
A 
nationwide 
COVID-19 
related 
curfew, 
from 
23.00-4.00, 
will 
go 
into 
effect 
from 
19 
December. 
Flight 
cancellations 
have 
been 
reported 
at 
Nadi 
and 
Nausori 
international 
airports 
until 
at 
least 
18 
December. 
The 
Fiji 
Natural 
Disaster 
Management 
Office 
(NDMO) 
has 
suspended 
all 
ferry 
and 
public 
transport 
services 
until 
further 
notice. 
All 
schools 
and 
bank 
branches 
under 
the 
Association 
of 
Banks 
in 
Fiji 
are 
also 
closed. 
The 
NDMO 
has 
assured 
the 
public 
that 
essential 
services 
will 
remain 
available. 
Infrastructure 
damage 
from 
strong 
winds 
and 
severe 
flooding 
has 
been 
reported 
in 
villages 
on 
Koro 
and 
Taveuni 
islands. 
Power 
outages 
and 
disruption 
to 
water 
supply 
and 
telecommunications 
have 
been 
reported, 
including 
in 
Viti 
Levu. 
This 
may 
last 
several 
days 
or 
even 
weeks. 
Following 
the 
passage 
of 
former 
severe 
tropical 
cyclone 
Harold 
in 
April, 
power 
was 
not 
restored 
for 
several 
weeks. 
Yasa 
may 
also 
exacerbate 
existing 
water 
supply 
issues 
in 
southern 
Naitasiri 
province 
(Central 
division, 
Viti 
Levu).
