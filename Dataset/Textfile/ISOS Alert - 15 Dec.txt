Members 
in 
Fiji 
in 
the 
coming 
days 
should 
prepare 
to 
minimise 
non-essential 
movement 
during 
the 
passage 
of 
Severe 
Tropical 
Cyclone 
Yasa. 
The 
weather 
system 
is 
currently 
located 
between 
Fiji 
and 
Vanuatu 
and 
has 
strengthened 
into 
a 
Category 
4 
cyclone 
(second 
highest 
on 
a 
five-tier 
scale). 
The 
Fiji 
Meteorological 
Service 
(FMS) 
has 
forecast 
that 
Yasa 
will 
further 
intensify 
into 
a 
Category 
5 
cyclone 
when 
it 
passes 
through 
Fiji 
on 
17 
December. 
Heavy 
rain 
and 
strong 
winds 
can 
be 
expected 
across 
much 
of 
the 
country 
on 
16-18 
December 
should 
the 
cyclone 
continue 
on 
its 
current 
trajectory. 
MORE 
DETAIL 
Evacuation 
preparations 
are 
underway 
ahead 
of 
Yasa. 
Significant 
infrastructural 
damage 
and 
power 
outages 
can 
be 
expected 
during 
the 
cyclone's 
passage. 
Disruption 
to 
transport, 
including 
bus 
services, 
is 
also 
likely 
across 
Fiji. 
Flight 
cancellations 
at 
Nadi 
(NAN) 
and 
Nausori 
(SUV) 
international 
airports 
on 
Viti 
Levu 
island 
(where 
the 
capital 
Suva 
is 
located) 
are 
likely 
to 
be 
announced 
in 
the 
coming 
days. 
A 
heavy 
rain 
warning 
remains 
in 
place 
for 
the 
Yasawa 
and 
Mamanuca 
island 
groups, 
as 
well 
as 
for 
the 
eastern 
part 
of 
Viti 
Levu, 
Vanua 
Levu, 
Taveuni 
and 
other 
nearby 
smaller 
islands. 
The 
rest 
of 
Fiji 
remains 
under 
heavy 
rain 
alert. 
In 
addition, 
a 
flash 
flood 
alert 
has 
been 
issued 
for 
low-lying 
areas 
and 
areas 
near 
riverbanks 
on 
Viti 
Levu 
island. 
WHAT 
WE 
ADVISED 
YOUR 
PEOPLE 
Inbound 
travellers 
 
Continue 
to 
defer 
travel 
to 
Fiji 
due 
to 
restrictions 
related 
to 
COVID-19. 
Managers 
 
Regularly 
monitor 
the 
status 
of 
staff. 
Telecommunications, 
including 
mobile 
internet 
services, 
may 
be 
temporarily 
disrupted 
in 
affected 
areas, 
making 
it 
difficult 
to 
contact 
stranded 
employees. 
 
Continue 
to 
monitor 
our 
alerts 
and 
local 
weather 
warnings, 
including 
the 
FMS 
website 
for 
the 
latest 
forecasts. 
Disseminate 
timely 
and 
relevant 
information 
to 
employees. 
 
Ensure 
staff 
comply 
with 
all 
local 
government 
directives 
including 
evacuation 
warnings 
and 
emergency 
response 
efforts.

In-country 
employees 
 
The 
intensity 
and 
trajectory 
of 
tropical 
storms 
can 
change 
abruptly. 
Monitor 
the 
FMS 
website 
for 
up-to-date 
information 
on 
weather 
conditions. 
Be 
prepared 
to 
adjust 
itineraries 
at 
short 
notice. 
 
We 
do 
not 
hold 
specific 
information 
on 
flights 
and 
other 
modes 
of 
transport. 
Liaise 
with 
the 
relevant 
providers 
to 
reconfirm 
schedules 
and 
access 
to 
facilities 
before 
setting 
out. 
 
Prepare 
to 
minimise 
non-essential 
movement 
during 
the 
passage 
of 
the 
weather 
system 
in 
the 
country. 
This 
period 
is 
likely 
between 
17 
and 
19 
December. 
Follow 
all 
official 
directives, 
including 
any 
evacuation 
orders. 
Any 
essential 
movement 
should 
be 
conducted 
after 
reconfirming 
the 
feasibility 
of 
overland 
journeys 
via 
local 
contacts 
before 
setting 
out. 
 
Prepare 
a 
grab 
bag 
with 
essentials 
such 
as 
a 
torch 
(flashlight), 
a 
medical 
kit, 
water 
and 
high-energy 
foods 
in 
case 
an 
emergency 
relocation 
becomes 
necessary. 
Charge 
all 
communications 
devices 
and, 
where 
feasible, 
keep 
extra 
batteries. 
Ensure 
that 
you 
have 
enough 
supplies 
to 
support 
a 
stand-fast 
period 
of 
at 
least 
72 
hours 
after 
the 
passage 
of 
the 
storm. 
 
Flash 
floods 
and 
landslides 
are 
possible 
during 
and 
following 
heavy 
rain. 
Avoid 
coastal 
and 
low-lying 
areas 
and 
do 
not 
travel 
through 
flooded 
areas. 
If 
you 
encounter 
a 
flooded 
road, 
turn 
around 
and 
find 
another 
route 
to 
your 
destination. 
 
Disruption 
to 
essential 
services, 
such 
as 
electricity 
supplies, 
is 
possible 
as 
a 
result 
of 
heavy 
rain 
and 
strong 
winds. 
Charge 
all 
communication 
devices 
and, 
where 
feasible, 
keep 
extra 
batteries 
for 
backup. 
 
Liaise 
with 
local 
contacts 
and 
monitor 
our 
alerts 
on 
Fiji 
for 
updates.
