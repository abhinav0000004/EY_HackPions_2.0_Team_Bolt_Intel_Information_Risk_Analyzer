Members 
in 
Fiji 
in 
the 
coming 
days 
should 
continue 
to 
plan 
journeys 
accounting 
for 
disruption 
due 
to 
the 
passage 
of 
Tropical 
Cyclone 
Yasa. 
The 
weather 
system, 
currently 
located 
between 
Fiji 
and 
Vanuatu, 
has 
intensified 
into 
a 
Category 
2 
cyclone 
(second 
lowest 
on 
a 
five-tier 
scale). 
According 
to 
the 
Fiji 
Meteorological 
Service 
(FMS), 
Yasa 
will 
likely 
further 
strengthen 
into 
a 
Category 
3 
cyclone 
(middle) 
by 
15 
December, 
while 
moving 
south-east 
towards 
Fiji. 
The 
storm 
is 
expected 
to 
bring 
heavy 
rain 
and 
strong 
winds 
to 
most 
of 
the 
country 
upon 
its 
arrival. 
Flight 
disruption 
is 
possible, 
including 
at 
Nadi 
(NAN) 
and 
Nausori 
(SUV) 
international 
airports 
on 
Viti 
Levu 
island. 
MORE 
DETAIL 
The 
FMS 
has 
issued 
a 
heavy 
rain 
warning 
for 
the 
Yasawa 
and 
Mamanuca 
island 
groups, 
as 
well 
as 
for 
the 
eastern 
part 
of 
Viti 
Levu, 
Vanua 
Levu, 
Taveuni, 
and 
other 
nearby 
smaller 
islands. 
Such 
conditions 
could 
lead 
to 
flooding 
and 
landslides 
in 
vulnerable 
areas. 
WHAT 
WE 
ADVISED 
YOUR 
PEOPLE 
 
The 
intensity 
and 
trajectory 
of 
tropical 
storms 
can 
change 
abruptly. 
Monitor 
the 
FMS 
website 
for 
up-to-date 
information 
on 
weather 
conditions. 
Be 
prepared 
to 
adjust 
itineraries 
at 
short 
notice. 
 
We 
do 
not 
hold 
specific 
information 
on 
flights 
and 
other 
modes 
of 
transport. 
Liaise 
with 
the 
relevant 
providers 
to 
reconfirm 
schedules 
and 
access 
to 
facilities 
before 
setting 
out. 
 
Flash 
floods 
and 
landslides 
are 
possible 
during 
and 
following 
heavy 
rain. 
Avoid 
coastal 
and 
low-lying 
areas 
and 
do 
not 
travel 
through 
flooded 
areas. 
If 
you 
encounter 
a 
flooded 
road, 
turn 
around 
and 
find 
another 
route 
to 
your 
destination. 
 
Disruption 
to 
essential 
services, 
such 
as 
electricity 
supplies, 
is 
possible 
as 
a 
result 
of 
heavy 
rain 
and 
strong 
winds. 
Charge 
all 
communication 
devices 
and, 
where 
feasible, 
keep 
extra 
batteries 
for 
backup. 
 
Liaise 
with 
local 
contacts 
and 
monitor 
our 
alerts 
on 
Fiji 
for 
updates.
