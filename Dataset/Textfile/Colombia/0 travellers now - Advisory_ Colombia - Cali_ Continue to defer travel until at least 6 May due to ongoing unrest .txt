of 
Colombia 
announced 
the 
resumption 
of 
commercial 
operations 
at 
Alfonso 
Bonilla 
Aragon 
International 
Airport 
(CLO). 
The 
airport 
previously 
ceased 
operations 
due 
to 
persistent 
blockades 
on 
roads 
to 
the 
facility. 
Ongoing 
protests 
have 
triggered 
clashes 
between 
protesters 
and 
the

resulted 
in 
other 
disturbances. 
As 
a 
result 
of 
the 
blockades, 
some 
gas 
stations 
and 
supermarkets 
have 
reported 
shortages 
of 
fuel 
and 
some 
foodstuffs.

as 
well 
as

growing 
concerns 
due 
to 
the 
roadblocks. 


The 
police 
are 
liable 
to 
use 
harsh 
measures

use 
of 
such 
measures, 
including 
live

banks 
and 
commercial 
establishments 
throughout 
the 
city. 
A 
police 
substation 
was 
damaged 
in

del 
Comercio 
on 
the 
evening 
on 
1 
May.
