POLITICAL 


President 
Iván 
Duque 
on 
2 
May 
withdrew 
a 
controversial 
tax 
reform 
after 
a 
series 
of 
protests 
across 
the 
country 
least 
six 
people 
dead 
and 
hundreds 
injured. 


• 
Unions 
had 
initially 
called 
a 
national 
strike 
to 
oppose 
the 
tax 
bill 
on 
28 
April, 
before 
extending 
it 
to 
coincide 
International 
Workers’ 
Day 
marches 
on 
1 
May. 
• 
Despite 
the 
development, 
demonstrations 
are 
likely 
to 
persist 
and 
will 
be 
accompanied 
by 
acts 
of 
violence 
vandalism. 
• 
The 
Duque 
administration 
will 
remain 
set 
on 
passing 
a 
tax 
reform 
and 
will 
work 
on 
a 
new 
proposal 
widespread 
opposition 
in 
Congress 
and 
social 
unrest. 
• 
Business 
operations 
in 
the 
country’s 
main 
cities 
are 
unlikely 
to 
be 
directly 
targeted 
but 
will 
face 
indirect 
risks 
amid 
the 
protests. 
Strike 


Thousands 
of 
students, 
unions 
and 
other 
groups 
of 
citizens 
have 
engaged 
in 
multiple 
nationwide 
demonstrations 
the 
Duque 
administration 
since 
28 
April. 
The 
protests 
emerged 
in 
response 
to 
a 
tax 
reform 
bill 
presented 
to 
Congress 
15 
April, 
which 
sought 
to 
reduce 
Colombia’s 
fiscal 
deficit 
and 
increase 
sales 
and 
income 
tax, 
among 
other 
proposed 
changes. 
Protests 
have 
evolved 
to 
reflect 
broader 
discontent 
by 
the 
population 
over 
issues 
including 
increased 
and 
unemployment 
amid 
the 
economic 
downturn 
brought 
about 
by 
the 
COVID-19 
pandemic. 
This 
will 
likely 
continue 


impact 
the 
social 
environment 
in 
the 
foreseeable 
future, 
leading 
to 
heightened 
levels 
of 
unrest. 
According 
to 
the 
Ombudsman 
on 
1 
May, 
at 
least 
six 
people, 
including 
one 
police 
officer, 
have 
been 
killed 
in 
protests, 
and 
179 
216 
police 
officers 
have 
been 
injured 
across 
the 
country. 


The 
government’s 
response 
to 
the 
protests 
has 
been 
somewhat 
erratic, 
with 
Duque 
initially 
insisting 
it 
was 
“impossible” 
withdraw 
the 
bill. 
Meanwhile, 
the 
security 
forces 
have 
been 
accused 
of 
being 
heavy-handed 
in 
some 
cases. 
According 
local 
media 
outlets, 
tear 
gas 
and 
water 
cannons 
were 
used 
by 
police 
to 
disperse 
protesters 
in 
the 
capital 
Bogotá 
(Valle 
del 
Cauca), 
which 
have 
also 
seen 
the 
most 
violence 
(including 
looting, 
the 
burning 
of 
city 
buses, 
and 
roadblocks). 



Bill 


Duque 
on 
1 
May 
said 
that 
bill 
would 
not 
be 
withdrawn, 
but 
would 
exclude 
sales 
tax 
on 
food 
or 
utilities, 
while 
the 
of 
income 
tax 
would 
be 
removed. 
However, 
on 
2 
May 
he 
announced 
that 
it 
would 
be 
withdrawn, 
and 
a 
new 
law 
drawn 
up. 
He 
vowed 
that 
the 
new 
proposal 
would 
be 
the 
result 
of 
consensus 
with 
other 
political 
parties 
and 
members. 
The 
government 
continues 
to 
insist 
that 
the 
reform 
is 
vital 
to 
avoid 
financial 
uncertainty, 
stabilise 
Colombia’s 
finances, 
maintain 
its 
credit 
rating 
and 
fund 
social 
programmes. 
While 
lawmakers, 
unions 
and 
other 
groups 
have 
the 
withdrawal 
of 
the 
bill 
as 
a 
victory, 
they 
will 
likely 
continue 
to 
protest 
over 
the 
coming 
days 
to 
demand 
concessions 
from 
the 
government. 
These 
include 
withdrawing 
a 
health 
system 
reform 
bill, 
more 
active 
social 
programmes 
for 
all, 
and 
the 
resignation 
of 
Finance 
Minister 
Alberto 
Carrasquilla, 
which 
is 
very 
likely 
to 
happen 
today

Business 
implications 


The 
security 
environment 
will 
remain 
highly 
challenging 
in 
the 
coming 
days, 
with 
a 
potential 
for 
further 
violent 
Foreign 
companies 
operating 
in 
Colombia 
are 
unlikely 
to 
be 
directly 
targeted 
by 
protesters. 
However, 
increased 
unrest, 
accompanied 
with 
violence 
and 
vandalism 
is 
very 
likely 
to 
have 
indirect 
implications 
on 
businesses 
operating 
Bogotá, 
Medellín 
(Antioquia 
department) 
and 
Cali. 
This 
includes 
blockades 
of 
main 
transport 
arteries, 
that 
can 


delays 
in 
the 
movement 
of 
goods 
or 
personnel.
