WHAT 
WE 
ADVISED 
YOUR 
PEOPLE 


• 
Avoid 
all 
associated 
demonstrations 
due 
to 
the 
risk 
of 
violence, 
including 
clashes 
between 
protesters 
and 
the 
police. 
Liaise 
with 
local 
contacts 
for 
details 
of 
related 
gatherings 
in 
your 
location 
and 
to 
plan 
alternative 
routes, 
where 
possible. 
• 
If 
travelling 
to 
or 
from 
the 
airport, 
reconfirm 
the 
status 
of 
routes 
prior 
to 
taking 
essential 
journeys 
and 
contact 
the 
relevant 
airline 
to 
reconfirm 
flights. 
• 
Abide 
by 
all 
official 
directives, 
including 
curfew 
orders. 
Monitor 
local 
media 
for 
details 
of 
such 
restrictions 
in 
your 
area 
and 
minimise 
non-essential 
movement 
in 
affected 
areas. 
• 
If 
travelling 
in 
the 
vicinity 
of 
demonstrations, 
anticipate 
heightened 
security 
and 
follow 
all 
official 
directives. 
Do 
not 
try 
to 
cross 
roadblocks 
erected 
by 
protesters, 
as 
this 
may 
elicit 
a 
hostile 
reaction. 
If 
you 
come 
across 
a 
roadblock, 
turn 
around 
and 
try 
to 
find 
an 
alternative 
route 
to 
your 
destination.
