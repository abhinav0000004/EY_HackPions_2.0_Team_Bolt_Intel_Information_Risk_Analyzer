Avoid 
the 
vicinity 
of 
ongoing 
protests 
in 
Barranquilla 
(Atlantico 
department) 
in 
the 
coming 
hours 
for 
Labour 
Day. 
Demonstrators 
blockaded 
Avenida 
Circunvalar 
with 
burning 
objects 
and 
marched 
toward 
Carrera 
27 
to 
denounce 
proposed 
tax 
reform. 
The 
security 
forces 
have 
deployed 
water 
cannon 
to 
disperse 
the 
demonstrations. 
Recent 
related 
protests 
in 
urban 
centres 
have 
resulted 
in 
clashes 
between 
participants 
and 
the 
security 
forces 
(see 
detailed 
alert). 


WHAT 
WE 
ADVISED 
YOUR 
PEOPLE 


• 
Avoid 
the 
area 
as 
a 
precaution. 
Liaise 
with 
local 
contacts 
to 
plan 
alternative 
routes, 
where 
necessary. 
• 
Do 
not 
try 
to 
cross 
any 
roadblocks 
erected 
by 
demonstrators, 
as 
this 
may 
elicit 
a 
hostile 
response. 
If 
you 
come 
across 
a 
roadblock, 
turn 
around 
and 
try 
to 
find 
an 
alternative 
route 
to 
your 
destination. 
• 
If 
travelling 
in 
the 
vicinity, 
anticipate 
heightened 
security, 
follow 
all 
official 
directives 
and 
allow 
additional 
journey 
time.
