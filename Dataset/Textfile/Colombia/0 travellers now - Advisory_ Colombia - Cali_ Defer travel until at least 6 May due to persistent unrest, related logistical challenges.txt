Defer 
travel 
to 
Cali 
(Valle 
del 
Cauca 
department) 
until 
at 
least 
6 
May 
due 
to 
persistent 
and 
widespread 
unrest 
and 
related 
logistical 
challenges. 
Ongoing 
protests 
in 
the 
city 
have 
triggered 
clashes 
between 
protesters 
and 
the 
police, 
as 
well 
as 
incidents 
of 
looting 
and 
vandalism. 
Roadblocks 
on 
key 
thoroughfares 
have 
disrupted 
travel 
to 
and 
from 
Alfonso 
Bonilla 
Aragon 
International 
Airport 
(CLO), 
and 
have 
also 
prompted 
the 
suspension 
of 
interdepartmental 
bus 
services 
to 
the 
city. 
As 
a 
result 
of 
the 
blockades, 
some 
gas 
stations 
and 
supermarkets 
have 
reported 
shortages 
of 
fuel 
and 
some 
foodstuffs. 
People 
in 
the 
city 
should 
minimise 
movement 
in 
the 
coming 
days. 


MORE 
DETAIL 


Further 
demonstrations 
involving 
clashes 
between 
protesters 
and 
the 
police 
are 
expected 
in 
Cali 
in 
the 
coming 
days. 
The 
police 
are 
liable 
to 
use 
harsh 
measures 
to 
respond 
to 
demonstrations. 
Various 
NGOs 
have 
denounced 
the 
use 
of 
such 
measures, 
including 
in 
some 
cases 
live 
ammunition 
against 
demonstrators. 
At 
least 
ten 
protesters 
were 
killed 
in 
confrontations 
between 
30 
April 
and 
3 
May. 
More 
than 
2,000 
members 
of 
the 
security 
forces 
have 
been 
deployed 
to 
the 
city 
in 
recent 
days 
to 
respond 
to 
protests. 


While 
protest 
activity 
can 
be 
expected 
throughout 
the 
city, 
the 
Calima, 
Paseo 
del 
Comercio, 
Puerto 
Rellena 
and 
Sameco 
neighbourhoods 
have 
been 
some 
of 
the 
most 
impacted. 
Individuals 
have 
looted 
various 
banks 
and 
commercial 
establishments 
throughout 
the 
city. 
A 
police 
sub-station 
was 
damaged 
in 
Paseo 
del 
Comercio 
on 
the 
evening 
on 
1 
May. 
While 
Alfonso 
Bonilla 
Aragon 
airport 
remains 
operational, 
roadblocks 
have 
intermittently 
complicated 
travel 
to 
and 
from 
the 
facility. 
Public 
bus 
operations 
in 
the 
city 
have 
been 
suspended 
following 
vandalism 
and 
other 
disturbances, 
while 
the 
Coomotor 
interdepartmental 
bus 
company 
has 
halted 
routes 
to 
the 
city 
due 
to 
roadblocks. 


The 
demonstrations 
began 
on 
28 
April 
as 
part 
of 
a 
national 
strike 
over 
a 
controversial 
proposed 
tax 
bill 
and 
other 
grievances. 
While 
President 
Ivan 
Duque 
scrapped 
the 
bill 
after 
days 
of 
unrest, 
demonstrations 
have 
continued 
in 
Cali 
over 
the 
heavy-handed 
police 
response 
and 
other 
issues. 


WHAT 
WE 
ADVISED 
YOUR 
PEOPLE 


• 
Defer 
travel 
to 
Cali 
due 
to 
persistent 
unrest 
and 
logistical 
complications, 
including 
transport 
disruption, 
as 
well 
as 
potential 
shortages 
of 
fuel 
and 
some 
foodstuffs. 
International 
SOS 
advises 
against 
travel 
to 
the 
city 
until 
6

and 
may 
extend 
or 
alter 
this 
advice 
depending 
on 
conditions 
on 
the 
ground. 


• 
Those 
in 
the 
city

the 
coming 
days. 
Reconfirm 
the 
status 
of 
routes 
prior 
to 
conducting 
essential 
movement 
in 
the 
city. 
• 
Avoid 
all 
demonstrations

the 
credible

security 
presence 
in 
the 
city. 
Follow
